## ðŸ’¡ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public
â””â”€â”€ src
    â”œâ”€â”€ components
    â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts
    â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ utilities
    â”œâ”€â”€ content
    â”œâ”€â”€ pages
    â””â”€â”€ style
```

- _pages_ - This directory is significant for Astro. Files here become URLs.
- _components_ - Template parts, layouts, utilities, all go here.
- _content_ - Keep the content separate from the system for clearer separation.
- _style_ - Global SCSS styles.
- _public_ - A directory where to place any static files that need to be used on the site.
